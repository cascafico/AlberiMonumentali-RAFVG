# AlberiMonumentali-RAFVG

## about
This repo is about importing Alberi Monumentali (historical trees) in Openstreetmap. Source dataset has been published by italian "Ministero delle politiche agricole alimentari, forestali e del turismo" (Mipaaft).

## source data
National dataset is splitted in regional Excel files which cover the whole italian territory. This repo considers only regional excel file downloadable at Mipaaf page and named "Friuli Venezia Giulia 9.8.2018"

## flow
Dataset will be adapted in order to generate OSM files suitable to be imported in planet.osm. It will not be a complete blind import: source data will be checked by mappers through an audit support map.

The import is being discussed on the national OSM mailing list. The import will be the result of consensus there.
